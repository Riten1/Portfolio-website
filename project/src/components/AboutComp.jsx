      <p className='text-sm font-medium text-gray-500 leading-7 text-left'>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Riten Gurung, a passionate frontend developer based in Nepal. With a love for turning creative ideas into tangible, interactive experiences, I thrive on the challenges and rewards of web development. I believe in the power of combining creativity with precision. Crafting pixel-perfect, visually stunning user interfaces is not just a job for me - it's my passion. My goal is to create user interfaces that go beyond aesthetics â€“ they should feel intuitive and enhance the overall user experience. I pay attention to user feedback and iterate to ensure the best possible interaction. I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and connecting with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn, explore my GitHub repositories, or drop me an email. Let's create something remarkable together!</p>
